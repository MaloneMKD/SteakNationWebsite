Steak Nation 

Steak Nation is a restuarant that I made up and created a website for as a project.
I used Python and Flask for the backend and html and css for the frontend including bootstrap.
The website has a home page, a menu page where it features the restuarant's menu, a reservations page where customers can log in and
create a reservation and a staff page to show the restuarant staff.
The reservations page also allows an administrator to log in and view all reservations by all users.
